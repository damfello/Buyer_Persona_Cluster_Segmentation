# Buyer_Persona_Cluster_Segmentation
Buyer Persona based on a Cluster Model.


## Description
The final objective of this Project it’s to design a Buyer Persona based on an unsupervised clustering model trained with customers data of a supermarket. 
The customer segmentation intro groups will be specially useful to the marketing team, so they can increase convertions rates of the different campaigns and communications channels. Also the user experience of customers will increase, considering they won’t be receiving promotions for diapers, when they don't even have kids. 

## Methods and techniques used

* Data scaling
* Principal Analysis Components 
* Elbow Method
* Clustering Model
